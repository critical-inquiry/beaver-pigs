**Welcome to beaver-pigs, the MIT police logs repository.**

This project is the spiritual successor of the original [mit/police-logs](https://github.com/mit/police-logs) project (2017-2021). 

We are indebted to -- and proud to continue -- the crucial work of the previous generation of students, workers, and scientists who were committed to an open-access archiving of the activities of campus police!
